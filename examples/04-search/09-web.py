# "X IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN Y"
# Here is a rough example of how to build a web miner.
# It mines comparative statements from Bing and stores the results in a table,
# which can be saved as a text file for further processing later on.

# Pattern matching also works with Sentence objects from the MBSP module.
# MBSP's parser is much more robust (but also slower).
