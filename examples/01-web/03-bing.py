# This example retrieves results from Bing based on a given query.
# The Bing search engine can retrieve up to a 1000 results (10x100) for a query.

# Bing's "Custom Search API" is a paid service.
# The pattern.web module uses a test account by default,
# with 5000 free queries per month shared by all Pattern users.
# If this limit is exceeded, SearchEngineLimitError is raised.
# You should obtain your own license key at: 
# https://datamarket.azure.com/account/
engine = Bing(license=None, language="en")

# Quote a query to match it exactly:
q = "\"is more important than\""

# When you execute a query,
# the script will halt until all results are downloaded.
# In apps with an infinite main loop (e.g., GUI, game),
# it is often more useful if the app keeps on running 
# while the search is executed in the background.
# This can be achieved with the asynchronous() function.
# It takes any function and that function's arguments and keyword arguments:
request = asynchronous(engine.search, q, start=1, count=100, type=SEARCH, timeout=10)

# This while-loop simulates an infinite application loop.
# In real-life you would have an app.update() or similar
# in which you can check request.done every now and then.
