# The pattern.web module has a SearchEngine class,
# with a SearchEngine.search() method that yields a list of Result objects.
# Each Result has url, title, text, language, author and date and properties.
# Subclasses of SearchEngine include:
# Google, Bing, Yahoo, Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Flickr, ...

# This example retrieves results from Google based on a given query.
# The Google search engine can handle SEARCH type searches.
# Other search engines may also handle IMAGE, NEWS, ...

# Google's "Custom Search API" is a paid service.
# The pattern.web module uses a test account by default,
# with a 100 free queries per day shared by all Pattern users.
# If this limit is exceeded, SearchEngineLimitError is raised.
# You should obtain your own license key at:
# https://code.google.com/apis/console/
# Activate "Custom Search API" under "Services" and get the key under "API Access".
# Then use Google(license=[YOUR_KEY]).search().
# This will give you 100 personal free queries, or 5$ per 1000 queries.

# Veale & Hao's method for finding similes using wildcards (*):

# - "as cute as a cupcake",
# - "as drunk as a lord",
# - "as snug as a bug", etc.
q = "as * as a *"

# Google is very fast but you can only get up to 100 (10x10) results per query.
