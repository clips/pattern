# This example retrieves an article from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org).
# Wikipedia queries request the article HTML source from the server. This can be slow.
# It is a good idea to cache results from Wikipedia locally,
# and to set a high timeout when calling Wikipedia.search().

# Contrary to the other search engines in the pattern.web module,
# Wikipedia simply returns one WikipediaArticle object (or None),
# instead of a list of results.

# Article title (may differ from the search query).

# Article in French, can be retrieved with Wikipedia(language="fr").

print(article.external[:5], "...")  # List of external URL's.

# print article.source # The full article content as HTML.
# print article.string # The full article content, plain text with HTML
# tags stripped.

# An article is made up of different sections with a title.
# WikipediaArticle.sections is a list of WikipediaSection objects.
# Each section has a title + content and can have a linked parent section
# or child sections.
