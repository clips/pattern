# The pattern.web module includes an interesting sort() algorithm.
# Ir classifies search terms according to a search engine's total results count.
# When a context is defined, it sorts according to relevancy to the context:
# sort(terms=["black", "green", "red"], context="Darth Vader") =>
# yields "black" as the best candidate,
# because "black Darth Vader" yields more search results.
