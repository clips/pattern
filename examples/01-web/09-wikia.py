# However, we may not know exactly what kind of articles exist,
# three-headed monkey" for example does not redirect to the above article.

# We can iterate through all articles with the Wikia.articles() method
# (note that Wikipedia also has a Wikipedia.articles() method).
# The "count" parameter sets the number of article titles to retrieve per query.
# Retrieving the full article for each article takes another query. This
# can be slow.
